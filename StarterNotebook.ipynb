    "Once upon a time, an ambitious engineer was tasked with inventing an “egg-maker” — a marvelous machine that could whip up eggs in all their delicious forms: fried, scrambled, poached, you name it. But somewhere along the way, wires got crossed (literally), and instead of producing eggs, the machine started… drawing them. Perfectly neat outlines of every egg recipe you could imagine appeared on paper, but not a single breakfast was served.\n",

    "### Mechanism Representation\n",
    "Here we will briefly discuss how we can represent linkage mechanisms. In this demonstration we will represent linkage mechanisms as graphs. A graph is represented as a set of nodes (e.g., $N = \\{1,2,3,\\ldots,N\\}$), and set of edges, that describe how nodes are connected to each other (e.g., $E=\\{(1,2), (5,2), \\ldots \\}$). Graphs can also include features associated with each node (e.g., initial positions of joints in our example of mechanisms).\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how this works take the mechanism below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div width=\"100%\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/qsPC0gC/2021-09-13-0hl-Kleki.png\" alt=\"Path Synthesis Problem\" width=\"40%\" style=\"margin:auto;display:block\"></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that we have 5 joints, which we will represent as 5 nodes, $N=\\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$, and we can represent the linkages as edges in the graph, which give us the edges $E=\\{(0,2),(1,3),(2,3),(2,4),(3,4)\\}$. Note that edges in this graph do not have directions so $(0,2)$ and $(2,0)$ are identical. To keep things neat so we put the smaller index first. Besides the basic graph describing the mechanisms structure, we also see that all nodes have an initial position in 2D space. Nodes $0$ and $1$ are fixed and will remain in place, while the others will move. We will describe these as node features. This means each node will have a 2D initial position and a binary feature describing whether it is fixed or not. We can also see that one of the linkages is highlighed yellow. This is the linkage that is rotated by the actuator. We will also store this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice the above description boils down to a few (Design) variables in python which we use to describe the mechanism:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial Positions** `x0`: A 2D array of size $N \\times 2$, holding the initial positions of the $N$ joints in the mechanism.\n",
    "- **Linkages** `edges`: A 2D array of ***integer*** pairs, with shape $E \\times 2$ holding the pairs of node indecies from two nodes that are connected to each other by an edge.\n",
    "- **Fixed Joints** `fixed_joints`: A list of node indices that are fixed.\n",
    "- **Motor** `motor`: A tuple of integers, which is equivalent to the pair of node indices associated with the actuated edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "This representation is fine, however sometimes instead of explicitly specifying edges a different approach is used to describe graph connectivity. The so called <b>Adjacency/Connectivity Matrix</b> is another way to represent the edges of a graph. A linkage mechanisms structure can therefore be represented using a matrix of connectivity ($C$), which is similar to the adjacency matrix in graphs (networks). The connectivity matrix for a mechanisms with $N$ nodes is a symmetric $N\\times N$ matrix with each row and column representing each node and its connections to other nodes. Take the example below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://transportgeography.org/wp-content/uploads/simple_connectivity_matrix2.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"max-width: 700px; display:block; margin:auto;\" alt=\"Connectivity Matrix\">\n",
    "\n",
    "For Node A we use the first row/column of the matrix and we see that A is connected to B (which is represented by the second row/column). To represent this connection in the connectivity matrix we will set the value of the $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$ elements of the matrix to be 1. Similarly any time any nodes $i$ and $j$ are connected with an edge we set the value of the $(i,j)$ and $(j,i)$ elements to be 1 and 0 if the nodes are not connected. We will use this kind of representation in the advanced starter notebook to show how this can help us define a problem for GA that generates the structure of the mechanism as well."
